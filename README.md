# UnitConverterAssembly

A simple unit converter I wrote back in 2012 in MIPS Assembly for the ECM1411 Elements of Computing class.

The app converts user input in Meters into Feet and Inches (Imperial), Kilograms into Pounds and Ounces (Imperial), and Liters into Pints (Imperial).

See `Demo Output.txt` for a demo of how the app works.
